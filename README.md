# Obesity-Lifestyle-Data-Analysis-
* Conducted an end-to-end data analysis project to identify the key lifestyle factors influencing obesity and underweight 
conditions. Analyzed dietary habits, physical activity levels, transportation modes, and genetic indicators to uncover the root 
causes behind a 53% obesity rate and a 10% insufficient-weight rate. Built actionable insights showing how high-calorie 
intake, meal frequency, and low activity levels drive obesity, while low meal intake and excessive technology use contribute 
to underweight cases. Developed data-driven recommendations for improving eating patterns, encouraging physical activity, 
and promoting healthier lifestyle choices. Delivered a comprehensive analytical report supporting targeted health 
interventions. 
* Technologies & Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
